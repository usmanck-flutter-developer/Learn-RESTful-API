✅ **Without Model Class** – Direct API calls for quick prototyping ⚡  
✅ **Handling API Requests** – GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods 🔄  
✅ **Parsing JSON Data** – Convert API responses into usable formats 🔍  
✅ **Error Handling & Debugging** – Catch and manage API failures 🚨  
✅ **State Management** – Implement basic state handling for API data  

## 📖 Learning Outcomes  

By working on this project, you'll:  

- Understand **how REST APIs work** and how to consume them in Flutter.  
- Learn to **fetch, post, update, and delete** data via APIs.  
- Compare the advantages of **using Model Classes vs. Raw JSON Parsing**.
